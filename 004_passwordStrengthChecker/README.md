# Password strength checker
**Description** : This project is created using HTML, CSS and Javascript which checks the strength of the password and displays message in real time. 
- **A Strong password is**
- 8 characters long
- contains uppercase and lowercase
- contains numbers
- contains special characters
  
**Learnings** : Regular expressions and setTimeout are the new things which I have learned by this project. Regex is a sequence of patterns used in searching. It makes complex searching easier. By using setTimeout(), we can delay somthing.
